My name is Pavlo Vovcharuk. I am a master of Copmputer Sciences and I am also a master's degree student majoring in Project management in Poland.

I am a responsible and ambitious person with good quick-learning and teamwork skills. My main goal and desire is to start my career and to grow as a Software QA Manual with potential grows in the Automated Testing and of course also to develop testing knowelages and technical skills.
